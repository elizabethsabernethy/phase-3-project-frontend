# Phase 2 Final Project: The (Little) Library

This project utilized create-react-app to structure a basic react website, from which I adjusted to meet the specific paramters for the app I wanted to create. There is a self-contained JSON database to retrive and add data, as well as CSS to implement the styling. Function based components and react routing are the primary features of react which this app uses to create functionality. 

## Purpose of Project

The purpose of this website is to display books in a way that the user is able to view general information about the book, like/ dislike books, as well as add and remove books from the general collection and the my books page (noted as checking out or returning a book). The site also allows for users to add a book to the collection via a form.

When a user first enters the website, they will see the library homepage, which offers basic information about what the interactivity users can expect from the app. On every page, there is a navigation bar at the top, allowing the user to move between four pages, each with its own specific function.

The second page a user would likely visit is the one titled Collection. As mentioned with the homepage, the collection page has a navigation bar at the very top. Below this are two text sections informing the user about specific attributes for the collection page. The first piece of text dynamically shows how many books are available in the collection at the moment. The second piece of text notes the functionality of the page, i.e. being how a user can check out or like/dislike a book.

There is also a filter and sort dropdown where the user can search for a book in the collection based on the title, and the sort organizes the books alphabetically (or opposite), and by year (oldest, or newest). Additionally, this page shows a list of books as if they are displayed on a shelf.

Below each book is a heart button, to denote whether the user has liked the book, as evidenced by the change in opacity of the button.

The user can also interact with the book via 'hovering,' which reveals the summary of whichever book is being looked at.

Finally, the user can click on a book to 'check it out,' which moves the clicked book to the my books page, and removes it from the collection.

The third page of the app is labeled My Books. This page has much of the same functionality as the collection page with one less feature, that being the ability to like or dislike the book.

The final page of the app is a form for the user to add a new book to the collection. On this page there is a form input section for a title, author, summary and the year of publication.

Upon filling out each section and submitting the form, the new book can be viewed in the collection page.
